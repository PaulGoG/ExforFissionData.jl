# Observables

A quantity has one name in a configuration and one symbol in a path, a file name and a column
header. The configuration spells it out, so a file a user edits explains itself; the path and the
header carry the symbol, which is the field's own nomenclature. The convention in full, including
the identifier and configuration rules, is on the [Naming](naming.md) page.

| Abscissa | Symbol | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `mass`, `product_mass` | `A`, `A_p` | pre- and post-neutron fragment mass |
| `charge` | `Z` | fragment charge |
| `neutron_energy` | `E` | secondary neutron energy |
| `total_kinetic_energy` | `TKE` | total kinetic energy |

| Ordinate | Symbol | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `yield` | `Y` | fission yield |
| `multiplicity`, `multiplicity_per_fission` | `nu`, `nu_bar` | prompt neutron multiplicity, per fragment and per fragment pair |
| `fragment_kinetic_energy`, `product_kinetic_energy` | `E_K`, `E_K_p` | pre- and post-neutron fragment kinetic energy |
| `total_kinetic_energy`, `post_neutron_total_kinetic_energy` | `TKE`, `TKE_p` | pre- and post-neutron total kinetic energy |
| `neutron_kinetic_energy` | `eps` | centre-of-mass neutron energy |
| `spectrum`, `spectrum_maxwellian_ratio` | — | prompt fission neutron spectrum, absolute and as a ratio to a Maxwellian |

An abscissa is a **list**, because it is a joint index: `["mass"]`, or
`["mass", "total_kinetic_energy"]` for ν(A, TKE). A joint abscissa is therefore no separate
vocabulary item, and the directory it writes to is the ordinate, `vs`, then the abscissa
symbols — `nu_vs_A_TKE`, `Y_vs_A`, `spectrum_maxwellian_ratio_vs_E`.

The seven abscissae the archive can be asked for are `["mass"]`, `["product_mass"]`, `["charge"]`,
`["neutron_energy"]`, `["total_kinetic_energy"]`, `["charge", "product_mass"]` and
`["mass", "total_kinetic_energy"]`.

Each ordinate belongs to one EXFOR quantity code — `yield` to `FY`, the multiplicities to `NU`,
the kinetic energies to `E`, the spectra to `MFQ` — and the configuration does not name it: the
code is read from the ordinate. The quantity decides which datasets the archive offers at all, and
several ordinates impose no tags of their own, so a pairing that could be written down could be
written down wrong and would retrieve a different observable under the requested name.

Not every combination exists in the archive. ν(TKE), for instance, is reported as a pair quantity,
so `multiplicity_per_fission` against `["total_kinetic_energy"]` returns data where
`multiplicity` returns none.

## Not covered

Fragment and prompt-neutron observables only. Prompt-γ quantities — ⟨Eγ⟩(A), ⟨Nγ⟩(A) and the
prompt fission γ-ray spectrum — are outside the observable set, as are the neutron multiplicity
distribution P(ν) and the centre-of-mass spectrum Φ(ε), the last of which the archive does not
carry as a quantity of its own — with the consequence that a measurement in the centre of mass is
compiled under the same reaction code as a laboratory-frame one. The subentry heads its energy
column `E-CM`, and `23268009` (Göök, 2014), such a dataset, is rejected by
`Cf252_sf_spectrum_vs_E` on that heading rather than retrieved alongside laboratory spectra.

For the first two, exclusion is what the archive holds rather than a preference:

**Prompt-γ.** The quantity code is `MLT`, and it returns five datasets for 252-Cf and one for
235-U, none for 233-U or 239-Pu. Not one carries `MASS`: the largest is differential in secondary
γ energy, three are relative and miscellaneous, one is a single number, and the 235-U entry is
resonance-region. Under `MFQ` for 235-U(n,f), none of the 125 datasets carries `GAM` or a `,G`
branch, so the γ-ray spectrum is not there either.

**P(ν).** The distribution is coded `NUM` in the branch field — `,PR/NUM,NU` and `,NUM,NU` — and
is returned under `NU`, so the package already sees it and rejects it on tags. It cannot be
written: of the 33 such datasets across these four systems, 31 carry no abscissa column at all,
and the two exceptions carry one held constant over every row. In the `op=csv&plus=2` rendering
the neutron number exists only as the order of the rows. Retrieving it would mean asserting that
the nth row is ν = n−1 — an assumption about an entry's internal ordering that the rendering never
states, and which a file of one row per abscissa *value* would then present as data.

Spectra between two different fissioning systems — the `(A(n,f),PR,NU/DE)/(B(n,f),PR,NU/DE)`
ratio form the archive holds a good deal of — are a distinct observable and are excluded. A
spectrum expressed as a ratio to a Maxwellian is not: that is `spectrum_maxwellian_ratio`.

## Relative data

A prompt fission neutron spectrum is conventionally measured relative and normalised afterwards,
so for 235-U(n,f) most of what the archive holds is in arbitrary units: of the 125 datasets
offered under `MFQ`, 42 answer the query in arbitrary units against 15 in absolute ones, and a
thermal window narrows both to 11 and 6. Those datasets are retrieved, and **written under
`relative/` rather than beside the absolute ones**:

```
data/U235_nth/spectrum_vs_E/
├── *.dat        # absolute, PC/FIS/MEV or 1/EV
├── relative/    # arbitrary units — a shape, with no scale
├── subentries/
└── retrieval.toml
```

The separation is the point. A relative dataset cannot be put on a common scale with anything,
not even another relative dataset: each has to be normalised on its own before it is compared
with anything, and none may be averaged with absolute data. A reader that takes a whole directory
therefore cannot pick one up by accident. The run record marks each accepted dataset
`relative = true` or `false` and names them all in one warning.

This applies to the spectrum ordinates alone. For every other observable arbitrary units are
still fatal, because a relative value there is not interpretable — a kinetic energy in arbitrary
units is not an energy, and a multiplicity is a count whose scale is the whole quantity.
